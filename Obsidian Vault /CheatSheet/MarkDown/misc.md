Escaping characters
I want to type *this text surrounded by asterisks* but I don't want it to be
in italics, so I do this: \*this text surrounded by asterisks\*.
Keyboard keys
In GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a <kbd> tag to represent keyboard keys.

Your computer crashed? Try sending a
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>
Tables
Tables are only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown and are slightly cumbersome, but if you really want it:

| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |
| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |
| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |
| blah         | blah     | blah          |
or, for the same results

Col 1 | Col2 | Col3
:-- | :-: | --:
Ugh this is so ugly | make it | stop
