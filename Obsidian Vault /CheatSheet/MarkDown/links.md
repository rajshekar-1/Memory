You want links ?

Put the text to display in hard brackets [] followed by the url in parentheses ()

[Google](https://google.com)

<br />
This link has a title link. Hover above it to see.

[Click me!](https://fast.com/ "Link to fast.com")

relative path or link to local files work here

[Go to MarkDownCheetSheet](MarkDownCheatSheet.md).

no slash at the end for a file. 
For folder path add slash

Markdown also supports reference style links.

[Click this link][link1] for more info about it!
[Also check out this link][foobar] if you want to.

[link1]: http://test.com/ "Cool!"
[foobar]: http://foobar.biz/ "Alright!"

The title can also be in single quotes or in parentheses, or omitted entirely. The references can be anywhere in your document and the reference IDs can be anything so long as they are unique.

There is also “implicit naming” which lets you use the link text as the id.

[This][https://aka.ms] is a link.

[This]: http://thisisalink.com/

But it’s not that commonly used.
