### 8 data types in JavaScript 
- seven primitive data types:
1. number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
2. bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
3. string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
4. boolean for true/false.
5. null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
6. undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
7. symbol for unique identifiers.

- And one non-primitive data type:
8. object for more complex data structures.

- Object data types basically store complex data structures. so they are called 'Non Primitive'


#### What is null and undefined 

   Null is a value that you can assign to variable. Null is a value that exists so it isnt a null pointer or 
         Non existing value like in other languages

   Undefined means the variables value has not been assigned.
